# ioet-acme
Description: Exercise to count the number of coincidences of hours of work from a file.
To find the matches, use nested loops to check if an employee worked at the same time as others.
To solve the exercise I used an architecture similar to mvc.
I used object oriented paradigm.
I used clean code and solid techniques.
For testing I used the mocha framework.
